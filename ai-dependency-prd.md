## 📋 Executive Summary

### Product Vision
Create an engaging, anonymous assessment tool that helps users understand their relationship with AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity) through 10 adaptive questions that measure dependency levels while educating users about healthy AI usage patterns.

### Core Problem
With the explosion of LLM tools in 2024-2026, users have integrated ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and Perplexity into their daily lives without understanding:

- B) Google it like a responsible adult from 2010 *(Score: 3, Category: Awareness)*
- C) Write it down to think about later *(Score: 1, Category: Awareness)*
- D) Ask all the AIs and compare answers *(Score: 8, Category: General)*

**Scoring Logic:**
- Measures immediate AI dependency
- Identifies ChatGPT-first users vs. traditional search users
- High scores (8-10) indicate reflexive AI usage

---

### **Q2: Communication Patterns** (ChatGPT/Claude Focus)
*Category: ChatGPT + Claude Dependency*

**Question:** "You need to write an email. How does this usually go down?"

**Options:**
- A) Draft it myself, then have Claude make it 'more professional' *(Score: 6, Category: Claude)*

**Scoring Logic:**
- Identifies writing dependency patterns
- Distinguishes between AI-assisted vs. AI-generated content
- Claude users show more editing behavior; ChatGPT users show delegation

---

### **Q3: Social Intelligence** (Claude Dependency)
*Category: Claude Reliance*

## 📈 Scoring Algorithm & Analysis

### Scoring Categories

```javascript
const scoringSystem = {
  categories: {
    chatgpt: {
      maxScore: 30,
      questions: [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9],
      weight: 1.5  // ChatGPT is most widely used
    },
    claude: {
      maxScore: 30,
      questions: [2, 3, 5, 9],
      weight: 1.3
    },
    gemini: {
      maxScore: 20,
      questions: [3, 8],
      weight: 1.0  // Lower adoption
    },
    general: {
      maxScore: 100,
      questions: [1, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10],
      weight: 1.2
    },
    awareness: {
      maxScore: 10,
      questions: [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10],
      weight: -1.0  // Inverse scoring (higher awareness = lower dependency)
    }
  }
};
```

### Overall Dependency Calculation

```javascript
function calculateOverallDependency(responses) {
  // Sum weighted scores from all categories
  const chatgptScore = (scores.chatgpt / 30) * 100;
  const claudeScore = (scores.claude / 30) * 100;
  const geminiScore = (scores.gemini / 20) * 100;
  const generalScore = (scores.general / 100) * 100;
  
  // Awareness reduces overall score
  const awarenessReduction = (scores.awareness / 10) * 20;
  
  // Calculate weighted average
  const rawScore = (
    (chatgptScore * 1.5) +
    (claudeScore * 1.3) +
    (geminiScore * 1.0) +
    (generalScore * 1.2)
  ) / 5.0;
  
  // Apply awareness reduction
  const finalScore = Math.max(0, rawScore - awarenessReduction);
  
  return Math.min(100, Math.round(finalScore));
}
```

# 2. Create tables using SQL Editor
# Copy schema from earlier section

# 3. Enable Row Level Security
ALTER TABLE quiz_sessions ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE quiz_responses ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE quiz_scores ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

# 4. Create public access policies (anonymous data)
CREATE POLICY "Allow anonymous inserts" ON quiz_sessions
FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (true);

CREATE POLICY "Allow anonymous inserts" ON quiz_responses
FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (true);

CREATE POLICY "Allow anonymous inserts" ON quiz_scores
FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (true);

# 5. Create read-only policy for analytics dashboard (authenticated users only)
CREATE POLICY "Admin read access" ON quiz_scores
FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL);
```

#### Environment Variables
```env
# .env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-project-url.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key
```

### API Integration Example

```javascript
// supabase-client.js
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js'

const supabaseUrl = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
const supabaseAnonKey = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY

export const supabase = createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseAnonKey)

// Store quiz session
export async function storeQuizSession(sessionData) {
  // 1. Insert session
  const { data: session, error: sessionError } = await supabase
    .from('quiz_sessions')
    .insert({
      device_type: sessionData.deviceType,
      browser: sessionData.browser,
      country_code: sessionData.countryCode
    })
    .select()
    .single()

  if (sessionError) throw sessionError

  // 2. Insert responses
  const responsesToInsert = sessionData.responses.map(r => ({
    session_id: session.session_id,
    question_id: r.questionId,
    selected_option: r.selectedOption,
    response_value: r.value,
    category: r.category,
    time_spent_seconds: r.timeSpent
  }))

  const { error: responsesError } = await supabase
    .from('quiz_responses')
    .insert(responsesToInsert)

  if (responsesError) throw responsesError

  // 3. Calculate and insert scores
  const scores = calculateScores(sessionData.responses)
  
  const { error: scoresError } = await supabase
    .from('quiz_scores')
    .insert({
      session_id: session.session_id,
      overall_score: scores.overall,
      chatgpt_score: scores.chatgpt,
      claude_score: scores.claude,
      gemini_score: scores.gemini,
      general_score: scores.general,
      awareness_score: scores.awareness,
      profile_tier: scores.profileTier
    })

  if (scoresError) throw scoresError

  // 4. Mark session as completed
  await supabase
    .from('quiz_sessions')
    .update({ completed_at: new Date().toISOString() })
    .eq('session_id', session.session_id)

  return session.session_id
}
```
