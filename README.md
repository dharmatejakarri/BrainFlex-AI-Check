## 🚀 How to Deploy on GitHub Pages

1.  **Upload Files**:
    *   Upload `ai-dependency-quiz.html` to your GitHub repository.
    *   (Optional) Rename it to `index.html` if you want it to be the main page (e.g., `yourname.github.io/repository-name/`). If you keep it as `ai-dependency-quiz.html`, your link will be `.../ai-dependency-quiz.html`.

2.  **Enable GitHub Pages**:
    *   Go to your Repository **Settings**.
    *   Click on **Pages** (in the left sidebar).
    *   Under **Source**, select `Deploy from a branch`.
    *   Select your branch (usually `main` or `master`) and folder `/(root)`.
    *   Click **Save**.

3.  **Share the Link**:
    *   After a minute, GitHub will give you a link (e.g., `https://yourusername.github.io/repo-name/`).
    *   Share this link with anyone!
